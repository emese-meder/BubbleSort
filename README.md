# SortManager
Java project implementing different array sorting methods


**Project includes:**

### SwapNumber

A class that implements a method to swap two numbers, later to be used in sorting algorithms.

### BubbleSort: 

A class with a method implementing a way to sort the elements of a random length integer array into ascending order with Bubble Sort.

### SortedMerger

A class with a method implementing a way to merge two sorted arrays into one combined sorted array (ascending). 

### DivideAndMerge

A class with a method implementing a way to divide up an unsorted array into one element sub array and then use the SortedMerger to merge them into a single sorted array in ascending order (divide and conquer method). 

### BinaryTree

Consists of a class called BinaryTreeImpl that implements the BinaryTree interface to sort an array of ints by first puting them into a binary tree and then going through the tree to sort them, and a class called Node that sets up the methods and variables needed for building the binaryTree structure. Ascendign + descending.

### Main

A Main class that uses the above methods for a couple of example cases.
